An Ionic2 - Cordova application which can capture an image with the device's camera and also stores the image into a persistent storage(application's dedicated folder) on the device. This image can also be shared by the user to various social media sites from within the application. Also the image is immediately reflected in the device's gallery using the Cordova plugin refresh-gallery (which is a non Ionic Native cordova plugin developed for Ionic 1, but is configured to be used in Ionic 2 in this application).
